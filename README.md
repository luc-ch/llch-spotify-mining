# SPOTIFY-MINING

With this project, we are building a Postgres database with:

- The historical set of Spotify Charts of the daily 200 top songs for each country where Spotify has worked in since January, 2017.
- Each track's basic data consisting of its metadata.
- Each track's artists.
- Each artist's genres.
- Each track's features.
- Each track's audio analysis.
- Each track's lyrics.
